<li> <font size= "4.5"> Lyrics   </li>
                    We were staying in Paris </li>
<li>To get away from your parents </li>
<li>And I thought, “Wow </li>
<li>If I could take this in a shot right now </li>
<li>I don't think that we could work this out” </li>
<li>Out on the terrace </li>I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How </li>
<li>Could I let you fall by yourself </li>
<li>While I'm wasted with someone else?” </li>

<li>[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]If we go down then we go down together </li>
<li>They'll say you could do anythingThey'll say that I was clever </li>
<li>If we go down then we go down togetherWe'll get away with everythingLet's show them we are betterLet's show them we are better </li>
<li>Let's show them we are better </li>

<li>[Verse 2: Andrew Taggart] </li>
<li>We were staying in Paris </li>
<li>To get away from your parentsYou look so proudStanding there with a frown and a cigarette </li>
<li>Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet </li>
<li>Out on the terraceWe breathe in the air of this small town </li>
<li>On our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it </li>
<li>Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in </li>

<li>[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren]
<li>If we go down then we go down togetherThey'll say you could do anythingThey'll say that I was cleverIf we go down then we go down together </li>
<li>We'll get away with everythingLet's show them we are better </li>

<li>[Post-Chorus: Emily Warren & Andrew Taggart] </li>
<li>Let's show them we are </li>
<li>Show them we areLet's show them we are </li>
<li>Show them we are </li>
<li>Let's show them we are better </li>
<li>We were staying in ParisLet's show them we are better </li>
<li>Let's show them we are </li>
<li>Show them we areLet's show them we are </li>
<li>Show them we are </li>
<li>Let's show them we are better </li>

<li>[Chorus: Andrew Taggart & Emily Warren] </li>
<li>If we go down then we go down together </li>
<li>They'll say you could do anythingThey'll say that I was clever </li>
<li>If we go down then we go down together </li>
<li>We'll get away with everything </li>
<li>Let's show them we are better </li>
